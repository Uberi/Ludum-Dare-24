Theme: Evolution

Game making is hard if it's too open ended. I've tried to decide on a few things to make the details more concrete

* How can we interpret this creatively and uniquely?
* well obviously it has to be better somehow than the original idea
* well really there's not many other ways you can interpret it
* I mean it's just change over something, right?
* well anything feasible, anyways <= better go with the original interpretation, then, I guess
* What is evolution?
    * Change across generations
    * Generations of what?
        * Machines <= but this is cool too
        * Scenery/world <= I like this
        * Microorganisms <= DONE TOO MANY TIMES
        * Animals <= too much like Spore, also infeasible
* What kind of gameplay?
    * realtime control <= definitely this
    * set and watch
* What are the goal(s)?
    * Evolve best something? <= well, duh
    * get to evolve!
        * salmon run comes to mind
            * nice and achievable!
    * Oh, idea: evolve universe until the player finds something! <= I like this
        * requires control of the scenery directly or indirectly
            * I like indirectly, but have to make it engaging
        * how about creating life? <= whoa awesome
        * maybe the player goes back in time and tries to change history and evolve things for the better?
            * this will have to be short term, don't have time for anything too extensive
    * Evolve machines until they achieve sentience? <= on second thought this is cooler
* What are the obstacle(s)?
    * Evolution, obviously <= how uncreative
    * limited resources <= no way I hate those games
    * other evolving things making it difficult to evolve the things you want <= yeah this is good
    * butterfly effect <= nah too hard to implement
* What are the mechanisms by which the player interacts with stuff? <= WORK ON THIS
    * some sort of mouse control is gonna be necessary
    * or maybe I'll think up of some wierd keyboard control scheme, I dunno
    * anyways just need to have a way to modify stuff
* Visual style?
    * no time for full-color sprites, I think
        * also I don't have much skill in the art department
    * something with text in it!
        * by this I mean not a text based thing, but something that uses typography to complement the graphics
    * infinite canvas, somewhere
    * put an owl in, just because <= o/ tidbit
        * yay done
        * now it's a kangaroo!
    * top down, side scrolling, or what? something 2D, since 3D is a royal pain
        * well really those are the only two options
        * I'm going to vouch for top down, since side view implies gravity, a planet, and everything
* what's the scale?
* I basically see 3 possible options
* microscopic (bacteria, virii, nanorobots, etc.) <= done a lot of times, but still room for improvement and creativity
* normal sized (humans, animals) <= waaay too difficult to get the details right, you every try evolving humans? still, it makes for the best results whne done right
* big sized (planets, galaxies) <= hey! I think not too many people are doing this!

To summarize:

    * realtime control
    * evolving stuff faces competition from other evolving stuff
    * normal sized scale?
    * goal is to create life/perpetuate it?
    * minimal graphics unless we have time to spare
    * sidescrolling salmon-run-esque game
